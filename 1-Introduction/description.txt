Hello, world! My name is Jake Newman. I'm a first year studying industrial design and computer 
science. I'm really excited about this class. Hoping to learn more about R and data analytics. 
My programming experience has never focused on this topic - but I'm eager for a new challenge. 
Outside of school, web development and computational media are my primary interests.
